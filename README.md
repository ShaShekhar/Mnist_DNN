I have written this code to understand the basics of neural network.

The network.py file is directly taken Micheal Neilson book on Neural Network http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.

In this code the optimization is very slow, because every time single data is proceed through neural network and error is calculated.

This error is accumulated over the batch of data and then weights are updated.

The batch updated version batch_network.py is written to alleviate the problem of slow optimization.

In network_dropout.py file i show that how to implement dropout in neural network.

If anyone wants in depths knowledge of neural network mathematically, you can email at shashankprince76@gmail.com

Thanks.
